NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::Dispatcher - Simple yet Powerful Controller Class dispatcher for Dancer

DESCRIPTION
    This Dancer plugin provides a simple mechanism for dispatching code in
    controller classes which allows you to better seperate and compartmentalize
    your Dancer application. This plugin is a great building block towards giving
    your Dancer application an MVC architecture.
    
    Some of the benefits include code-reuse, compartmentalization, and better
    chaining of actions.

        use Dancer qw/:syntax/;
	use Dancer::Plugin::Dispatcher;
    
	get '/' 	 => dispatch '#index';
	get '/login' 	 => dispatch '#login';
	get '/dashboard' => dispatch '#check_session', '#dashboard';
	
	dance;
